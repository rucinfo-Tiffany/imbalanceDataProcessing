#Project imbalanceDataProcessing
This project is setup for dealing with imbalance data, especially used in classification. 
According to paper at http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/papers/2009/Zhi-FeiYe_CAAI-Transactions-on-Intelligent-Systems_2009.pdf, there are a total of 6 strategies of imabalanced data processing:
(1) Resampling
(2) Data Partition
(3) Classifier Ensemble
(4) Cost-Sensitive Learning
(5) Feature Selection
(6) Other Particular Methods
Based on the stategies listed below, the repo is also organized with 6 basis class. And the repo is based on scikit-Learn(also known as sklearn, scikit-learn.org) in python.
Here is a brief documentation:
-->CostSensitiveClassifier
-->DataPartition
-->EnsembleClassifier
-->Evaluation
-->Example
-->FeatureSelection
-->Resampling
